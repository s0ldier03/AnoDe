All the datasets are trimmed down versions of csv files in R2 tarball (synthetic datasets) provided at https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/Insider_Threat_Test_Dataset/12841247/1

Once you open the datasets, you will realise that they are self explanatory in terms of fields and actions they are capturing.

I trimmed them down as it was taking too long to process on my laptop. You are free to try with larger datasets. Fetch them from link above.
